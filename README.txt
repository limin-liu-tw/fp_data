Dataset
  Dataset can be created by:
  (1) merge them together
     $ cat xaa xab xac > data.tar.gz

  (2) unzip the compressed file
     $ tar zxvf data.tar.gz
 
Trained Model
  The model is trained by the above data with 360 units, 800 epochs, and 30 samples in a batch.
  mdl360_800_30.h5
  mdl360_800_30.yaml
  
Whole Images
  One can try the model on the test files with prefix For_PRL_.

Code for prediction
  One can use the trained model to do prediciton on previous images. You need to change directory names in this script to load the model and test image.
  Usage:
    python3 PRL_load_model_run.py mdl360_800_30 For_PRL_a002_03.png
